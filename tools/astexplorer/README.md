# Cadence AST Explorer

- `npm install` 
- `npm run start`

## Development

To use an in-development version of the parser, replace the dependency for the parser to the local package,
and follow the instructions there to build the WebAssembly binary for the parser and the package itself:

```json
"@onflow/cadence-parser": "file:../../npm-packages/cadence-parser",
```
